    Comparison Operators with Strings

#Part 1: Euqality == and Not Equal to != operators with Strings
# The == operator can check if two strings are equal to each other. 
# If they are equal, the Python interpreter returns a True result.
print("a string" == "a string")
True


# In this example, the equality == comparison is between "4 + 5" and
# 4 + 5. Since the left data type is a string and the right data type
# is an integer, the two values cannot be equal. So, the comparison
# returns a False result.
print("4 + 5" == 4 + 5)
False


# The != operator can check if the two strings are NOT equal to each
# other. If they are indeed not equal, then Python returns a True result.
print("rabbit" != "frog")
True


# In this example, the variable event_city has been assigned the string 
# value "Shanghai". This variable is compared to a static string, 
# "Shanghai", using the != operator. As, the strings "Shanghai" and 
# "Shanghai" are the same, the comparison of "Shanghai" != "Shanghai" 
# is false. Accordingly, Python will return a False result.
event_city = "Shanghai"
print(event_city != "Shanghai")
False

# This last example illustrates the result of trying to compare two
# items of different data types using the equality == operator. The
# two items are not equal, so the comparison returns False.
print("three" == 3)
False
