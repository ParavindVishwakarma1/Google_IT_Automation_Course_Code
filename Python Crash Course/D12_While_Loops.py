#While loops
"""
A while loop executes the body of the loop while a specified condition remains True. They are commonly used when there’s an unknown number of operations to be performed, and a condition needs to be checked at each iteration.

Syntax:
while specified condition is True:
    body of loop
"""

#Example of While loop
multiplier = 1
result = multiplier * 5
while result <= 50:
    print(result)
    multiplier += 1
    result = multiplier * 5
print("Done")


# This while loop prints the multiples of 5 between 1 and 50. The
# "multiplier" variable is initialized with the starting value of 1. 
# The "result" variable is initialized with the value of the 
# "multiplier" variable times 5. 

# The while loop specifies that the loop must iterate while it is True
# that the "result" is less than or equal to 50. Within the while loop, 
# the code tells the Python interpreter to print the value of the 
# "result" variable. Then, the "multiplier" is incremented by 1 and the
# "result" is assigned the new value of the "multiplier" times 5. 

# The end of the while loop is indicated by the indentation of the next 
# line of code moving one tab to the left. At this point, the Python
# interpreter automatically loops back to the beginning of the while
# loop to check the condition again with the new value of the "result"
# variable. When the while loop condition becomes False (meaning
# "result" is no longer less than or equal to 50), the interpreter exits
# the loop and reads the next line of code outside of the loop. In this 
# case, that next line tells the interpreter to print the string "Done". 

# Click the "Run" button to check the result of this while loop.

The following code contains an infinite loop, meaning the Python interpreter does not know when to exit the loop once the task is complete. To solve the problem, you will need to:

    1. Find the error in the code

    2. Fix the while loop so there is an exit condition

Hint: Try running your function with the number 0 as the input and observe the result.
