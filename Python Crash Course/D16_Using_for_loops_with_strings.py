Using for loops with strings
In an earlier video, you learned that a for loop iterates over the items in a collection until each item in the collection has been looped over. 

Pro tip: Every for loop can also be written as a while loop.

greeting = "Hello"
for c in greeting:
    print("Tne net cgar")
